# EEG-based-depression-detection-using-deep-learning
To thoroughly examine the properties of EEG signals and suggest a high-performance approach for mental state recognition, the researcher employed EEG signals as the research object and deep learning algorithms as the research theory. The usefulness and progress of the approach were confirmed by comparison studies after the network parameters and hyperparameters of the model were first improved through trials. The experimental findings demonstrate that:

(1) The strategy put forth in this research is more successful in identifying and diagnosing depression. 

(2) This approach may adaptively extract the characteristics of the EEG signals to obtain a greater classification accuracy than previous methods in the case of a limited number of repeats.
This technique offers a technological foundation for the diagnosis and screening of depression and performs superbly on public datasets. Comparative tests were used to confirm the method's efficacy and benefits. On the public dataset, the approach suggested in this research had a 98% accuracy rate.
